# Part 3 - Service broker integration

## Tutorial Flow

In this tutorial, we will go through the following flow:

* Provision a MySQL instance using Service Broker
* Connection settings for the MySQL service broker instance
* Write code to connect microservice version V2 to the MySQL instance
	![Part-3](images/Part-3.png)
* Access GET "/api/creditscore" (in a Browser or in Postman)
* Observe the microservice behaviour (in Vizceral, Zipkin, Grafana)

## Steps

### Provision a MySQL instance using Service Broker

1. Provision a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) / Persistent Volume (PV) / OCI Block Volume using V2 > aura-js-creditscore-v2/mysql-pvc.yaml file 

		$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sachin-pikle/aura-js-creditscore-v2/master/mysql-pvc.yaml 
		persistentvolumeclaim "mysql-pvc-01" created


2. Check the PVC from the Kubernetes Dashboard

3. Check the PV from the Kubernetes Dashboard

4. Check the Block Volume from the OCI console

![Block Volume](images/sb-mysql-oci-block-volumes.png)

5. Check the Volume Provisioner logs

6. Go to Admin console > Service Brokers

URL: http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1/namespaces/default/services/aura-admin-service:admin-service/proxy/console/#/serviceBrokers

7. Select MySQL (thirdparty-mysql-service)


8. Create New Instance of the MySQL service broker with the following values

	Instance Name: mysql-sb-inst-1

	Plan: basic

	Parameters: 

		Name: persistence.existingClaim

		Value: mysql-pvc-01  ... This is the name of the PVC we created above

![Create Instance](images/sb-mysql-create.png)


9. MySQL service broker instance created

10. Service Brokers home page

![Service Brokers](images/sb-list-post.png)


11. Search "sb-inst" from the K8s dashboard

![MySQL Service Broker K8s Elements](images/sb-mysql-sb-inst-01-k8s-dashboard-1.png)

![MySQL Service Broker K8s Elements](images/sb-mysql-sb-inst-01-k8s-dashboard-2.png)


12. OCI Dashboard you will see the block volume attached to an OCI instance

### Connection settings for the MySQL service broker instance

1. Service broker instance connection settings are automatically available as Kubernetes secrets. The secret name convention is secret-<sb-instance-name>. In this case the secret is secret-mysql-sb-inst-1. 

![Kubernetes mysql service broker secret](images/sb-mysql-secret.png)

2. Now that we have the connection details in the secret, configure the application deployment section of the kubernetes yaml to access this secret via an env block. Edit V2 > aura-js-creditscore-v2/kubernetes-deployment.yml.template

3. Look for the following line and make the requested changes 

		# _CHANGE_Part_3_Service_Broker_Integration_ : Uncomment the following env block to test service broker integration

![Kubernetes yaml env block](images/sb-mysql-k8s-yml-env-block.png)



### Write code to connect microservice version V2 to the MySQL instance

1. Edit V2 > aura-js-creditscore-v2/routes/creditscore.js

2. Look for the following lines and make the requested changes

		// _CHANGE_Part_3_Service_Broker_Integration_ :
		// 1) Comment the two methods res.setHeader() and res.send()
		// 2) Uncomment the entire db code block below to use DB

![Code changes to connect to mysql](images/sb-mysql-code-changes-2.png)

3. Commit the change

4. Wercker will fire the CI/CD workflow for V2. Check the progress on Wercker Pipelines > Runs.

![Workflow run](images/sb-mysql-w-run.png)

5. Check Releases to confirm the new container image has been uploaded

![Releases Image Uploaded](images/ms-w-run-initial-cr-image-v2.png)

6. Check the Kubernetes dashboard to see if the latest version got deployed. Takes ~35 seconds for K8s to terminate the old pods and start the new pod

![K8s Dashboard Shows Kubernetes Elements Created](images/ms-w-run-initial-k8s-dashboard-v1-v2-part-2.png)

7. Check the pod logs

![Pod Logs](images/ms-w-run-initial-pod-logs-v2.png)


### Access GET "/api/creditscore" (in a Browser or in Postman)

1. Access GET /api/creditscore in a browser and you should see the following message indicating successful DB communication

		{ "MESSAGE" : "SUCCESS communicating with DB" }

![Access API in Browser](images/sb-mysql-api-access-browser-output.png)


2. (OPTIONAL) Access GET /api/creditscore in Postman and you should see the following message indicating successful DB communication

		{  
			"MESSAGE": "SUCCESS communicating with DB"  
		}

![Access API in Postman](images/sb-mysql-api-access-postman-output.png)


### Observe the microservice behaviour (in Vizceral, Zipkin, Grafana)

1. Check the pod logs

![Pod Logs](images/sb-mysql-pod-logs.png)

2. Access Vizceral console (Limited visibility for now, more on the roadmap)

Known Issue: Screen shows the data flowing for ~1 minute. This view doesn't refresh automatically and must be refreshed manually by reloading the top level console

URL: http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1/namespaces/default/services/aura-admin-service:admin-service/proxy/console/#/vizceral

**a) Vizceral Console Top Level**

You will see traffic flowing from the internet in to your cluster. Note the service "aura-js-creditscore" pod is deployed in a single AD.

![Vizceral Console Level 1](images/ms-vizceral-level-1.png)

**b) Vizceral Console Next Level Drill Down**

Click on the circle next to "My Cluster". And you will see traffic flowing from the internet into your "aura-js-creditscore" service. Note: MySQL is not be visible (see known limitations) today.

Known Limitations: a) Vizceral needs to support gRPC, TCP metrics, right now it only support HTTP traffic. b) Currently, we do not inject istio sidecar into service broker instances (i.e. MySQL).

![Vizceral Console Level 2](images/ms-vizceral-level-2.png)

**c) Vizceral Console Service Details**

Click on the service circle named "aura-js-creditscore". And you will see additional details about your running aura-js-creditscore service

![Vizceral Console Level 3](images/ms-vizceral-level-3-v2.png)

3. Access Grafana dashboard (Limited visibility for now, more on the roadmap)

URL: http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1/namespaces/default/services/aura-admin-service:admin-service/proxy/console/#/grafana

![Grafana Part 1](images/ms-grafana-part-1.png)

![Grafana Part 2](images/ms-grafana-part-2.png)

4. Access Zipkin tracing (Limited visibility for now, more on the roadmap)

URL: http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1/namespaces/default/services/aura-admin-service:admin-service/proxy/console/#/zipkin

Find the last 10, sort by Newest first.

**a) Zipkin Tracing Top Level**

![Zipkin Level 1](images/ms-zipkin-level-1.png)

**b) Zipkin Tracing Second Level**

Explore trace by clicking on the first span. Note: MySQL is not be visible (see known limitations) today.

Known Limitations: a) Currently, we do not inject istio sidecar into service broker instances (i.e. MySQL) so we do not get automatic tracing/metrics collection

![Zipkin Level 2](images/ms-zipkin-level-2-v2.png)

**c) Zipkin Tracing Additional Details**

Get additional trace details by clicking on the first line of the span "aura-js-creditscore"
